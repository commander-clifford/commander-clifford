Some trails are on private land, you might get arrested for riding on these trails.  But those landowners are assholes if they press charges.  Don't build unauthorized features on highly visible trails, these trails live on a delicate balance reached between land owners and trails bosses, don't be the asshole who fucks it up for everyone else.  Do not alter features to lower said feature to your riding ability, instead build your own features and build your skills, then ride the original feature. </p>
